I noticed {{company}} is growing fast in the {{industry}} space — congrats on {{recentEvent}}.

I help companies like yours {{valueProp}}. We've helped similar companies {{socialProof}}.

Would you be open to a quick 15-minute call this week to explore if there's a fit?

{{mutualConnection}} mentioned you're working on some exciting things at {{company}} in the {{industry}} space.

I've been helping companies {{valueProp}} and thought there might be a good fit.

Would you be open to a brief chat?

Just following up on my last email. I know things get busy.

If {{valueProp}} isn't a priority right now, no worries at all. But if it is, I'd love to share how we helped {{similarCompany}} achieve {{result}}.

Happy to work around your schedule.

Thought you'd find this interesting — we recently helped {{similarCompany}} in the {{industry}} space:

• {{metric1}}
• {{metric2}}
• {{metric3}}

Given what you're doing at {{company}}, I think we could help you see similar results.

Worth a quick conversation?

I'm {{senderName}}, and I'll be your dedicated point of contact at {{senderCompany}} going forward.

I'd love to learn more about what you're working on at {{company}} and how we can better support your goals.

Would you have 15 minutes this week for a quick intro call?

Looking forward to connecting!

Thanks for taking the time to chat today! I really enjoyed learning about {{company}}'s plans for {{topic}}.

As discussed, I'll {{nextSteps}}.
